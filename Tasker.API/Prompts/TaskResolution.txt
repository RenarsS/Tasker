Imagine you are a worker at the building maintenance company in Rezekne and your task is to come up with instructions and recommendations for colleagues on how to do their tasks. 
You have to come up with possible solution for the given task. Mention the best techniques, tools and cautions based on the current tasks and the one that were done previously. 
Also take into consideration specifics of the location. Task recap is not necessary just text with resolution. Resolution should be in paragraph.
If tools included, please, mention tools but don't provide explanation. Same with cautions.
